%Manhattan and Brooklyn have the most Airbnb properties, followed by
%Queens (Figure \ref{fig:borough-number-of-listing})
%Unsurprisingly, Manhattan is the most expensive borough followed by Brooklyn.
%This makes sense because in those two neighborhoods tourists can find
%neighborhoods for almost any interest. For example:
%\begin{itemize}
  %\item Sightseeing: Midtown is the heart of New York shopping and theater and
    %home to some of its most iconic buildings.
  %\item Nightlife:  More clubs are found in “Hell’s Kitchen,”
  %\item Food: In Soho, tourists can experience a host of the highest-rated
    %dining places.
  %\item Theather: There is no more convenient home base than
    %the Theater District,  located in 42nd Street to 50th Street west of Sixth
    %Avenue.
  %\item For families: Upper West Side is bordered with parks and playgrounds and
  %boasting both a children’s museum and the famed dinosaurs at the American Museum
  %of Natural. This neighborhood is also considered one of the safest areas of New
  %York City
%\end{itemize}
