Airbnb has been increasingly gaining popularity since 2008 as an economical and
convenient way for tourists.  Setting the price right significantly contributes
to the financial success of Airbnb hosts. This project uses a sample of 50,000
accommodation rental offers in New York City, USA, to predict Airbnb properties'
rental price by using several machine learning algorithms.  We first perform
feature engineering and exploratory data analysis to get insights from the data.
We then implement and compare the prediction performance of four different
models: multiple linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and
xgboost.  The results highlight that : (a) XGBoost gives the most satisfying
prediction results of rental prices based on mean squared error and R2, (b) Room
type, the number of people a listing can accommodate, and location features are
the most important features to predict the rental price.
