I would first like to pay special regards to my thesis advisor Professor. Marco
Bee of the Department of Economics and Management at the University of Trento.
The door to Professor Bee's office was always open whenever I ran into a
trouble spot or had a question about my research or writing. He consistently
allowed this paper to be my work but steered me in the right direction
whenever he thought I needed it.

Some special words of gratitude go to my friends who have always been a
significant source of support when things get a bit discouraging: Federico,
Nick, Ivan, Thai, Giang, Thuy, Hong. Thank you guys for always be there for me.

Nobody has more important to me in the pursuit of this project than the members
of my family. I would like to thank my parents for their great love and
understanding. To my brother Lieu, you are always in my heart, and  I hope you
get well soon. Most importantly, I wish to thank my brother Ly for providing me with
unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and
through the process of researching and writing this thesis.
